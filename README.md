# purrr is better!

[`purrr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr) is a much better package for this use case than `eply`. Please use [`purrr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr).

The `eply` package processes batches of quoted expressions. Just as `apply()` acts on data frames of function arguments, `eply()` acts on data frames of quoted **expressions** that **return** arguments. The package also has `evals()`, which simply evaluates a character vector of quoted expressions, plus some nice utilities.

# Installation

First, ensure that [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is installed, as well as the dependencies in the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/wlandau/eply/blob/master/DESCRIPTION). To install the [latest CRAN release](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eply/), run
